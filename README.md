# dayjs-recur

This is a plugin for [Day.js](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs) that allows you to work with recurring dates. This plugin only handles dates, any time information is discarded.

## Getting Started

The following guide will help you install and use this plugin with Day.js

### Prerequisites

Day.js installed

### Installation

You can install via Yarn or npm

```bash
yarn add dayjs-recur
```

```bash
npm install dayjs-recur
```

## Usage Guide

You will need to import the plugin and activate it via the Day.js `.extend()` function

### ES6

```javascript
import dayjs from 'dayjs'
import dayjsRecur from 'dayjs-recur'

dayjs.extend(dayjsRecur)
```

### Node

```javascript
const dayjs = require('dayjs')
const dayjsRecur = require('dayjs-recur')

dayjs.extend(dayjsRecur)
```

### Creating a Recurring Date

You can create a recurrence from an instance of dayjs or from the constructor a few different ways.

#### From an instance

```javascript 
// Create a recurrence using today as the start date.
const recurrence = moment().recur();
 
// Create a recurrence while passing the start and end dates to the recur function.
// Note: passing an end date requires you to also pass a start date.
const recurrence = dayjs().recur( start, end );
 
// You may pass a start date to the instance of dayjs, or use an existing dayjs instance, to set the start date.
// In this case, passing a date to the recur function sets and end date.
const recurrence = dayjs(start).recur( end );
 
// Finally, you can create a recurrence and pass in an entire set of options.
recurrence = dayjs().recur({
    start: "01/01/2020",
    end: "01/01/2021"
});
```

#### From the constructor

```javascript  
// Create recurrence without a start date. Note: this will not work with intervals.
const recurrence = dayjs.recur();
 
// Create a recurrence, passing just the start, or the start and end dates.
const recurrence = dayjs.recur( start, end );
 
// Create a recurrence, passing set of options.
const recurrence = dayjs.recur({
    start: "01/01/2020",
    end: "01/01/2021"
});
```

### Creating Rules

dayjs-recur uses rules to define when a date should recur. You can then generate future or past recurrences based on these rules, or see if a specific date matches the rules. Rules can also be overridden or removed.

#### The every() Function
The `every()` function allows you to set the units and, optionally, the measurment type of the recurring date. It returns the recur object to allow chaining.

```js
// Create a date to start from
const myDate = dayjs("01/01/2020");

// You can pass the units to recur on, and the measurement type.
const recurrence = myDate.recur().every(1, "days");

// You can also chain the measurement type instead of passing it to every.
const recurrence = myDate.recur().every(1).day();

// It is also possible to pass an array of units.
const recurrence = myDate.recur().every([3, 5]).days();

// When using the dayOfWeek measurement, you can pass days names.
const recurrence = myDate.recur().every(["Monday", "wed"]).daysOfWeek();

// Month names also work when using monthOfYear.
const recurrence = myDate.recur().every(["Jan", "february"], "monthsOfYear");
```

`every()` will override the last "every" if a measurement was not provided. The following line will create a recurrence for every 5 days.
```js
const recurrence  = myDate.recur().every(1).every(5).days();
```
If you need to specify multiple units, pass an array to `every()`.

You may also pass the units directly to the interval functions (listed below) instead of using `every()`.
```js
const recurrence = dayjs.recur().monthOfYear("January");
```

#### Length Intervals
dayjs-recur supports intervals for days, weeks, months, and years. Measurements may be singular or plural (ex: `day()` vs `days()`). Length Intervals **must** have a start date defined.

Possible Length Intervals Include:
* day / days
* week / weeks
* month / months
* year / years

##### Examples
```js
// Create a date to start from
const myDate = dayjs("01/01/2020");

// A daily interval - will match every day.
const interval = myDate.recur().every(1).day();

// A bi-weekly interval - will match any date that is exactly 2 weeks from myDate.
const interval = myDate.recur().every(2).weeks();

// A quarterly interval - will match any date that is exactly 3 months from myDate.
const interval = myDate.recur().every(3).months();

// A yearly interval - will match any date that is exactly 1 year from myDate.
const interval = myDate.recur().every(1).years();

// It is possible to match multiple units of a single measure using an array.
const interval = myDate.recur().every([3, 5]).days();

// It is NOT possible to create compound intervals. The following will never match.
const interval = myDate.recur().every(3).days().every(2).months(); // Won't work
```


#### Calendar Intervals
Calendar Intervals do not depend on a start date. They define a unit of another unit. For instance, a day of a month, or a month of a year. Measurements may be singular or plural (ex: `dayOfMonth()` vs `daysOfMonth()`).

Possible Calendar Intervals Include:
* dayOfWeek / daysOfWeek
* dayOfMonth / daysOfMonth
* weekOfMonth / weeksOfMonth
* weekOfYear / weeksOfYear
* monthOfYear / monthsOfYear

##### Examples
```js
// Will match any date that is on Sunday or Monday.
const cal = dayjs.recur().every(["Sunday", 1]).daysOfWeek();

// Will match any date that is the first or tenth day of any month.
const cal = dayjs.recur().every([1, 10]).daysOfMonth();

// Will match any date that is in the first or third week of any month.
const cal = dayjs.recur().every([1, 3]).weeksOfMonth();

// Will match any date that is in the 20th week of any year.
const cal = dayjs.recur().every(20).weekOfYear();

// Will match any date that is in January of any year.
const cal = dayjs.recur().every("January").monthsOfYear();

// You can also combine these rules to match specific dates.
// For instance, this will match only on Valentines day
const valentines = dayjs.recur().every(14).daysOfMonth()
                               .every("Februray").monthsOfYear();

// A weekOfMonthByDay interval is available for combining with
// the daysOfWeek to achieve "nth weekday of month" recurrences.
// The following matches every 1st and 3rd Thursday of the month.
// (Note this cannot be combined at the moment with every(x).months() expression) 
const cal = dayjs.recur().every("Thursday").daysOfWeek()
                    .every([0, 2]).weeksOfMonthByDay();

const cal = dayjs.recur().every(dayjs("01/01/2020").day()).daysOfWeek()
                    .every(dayjs("01/01/2020").monthWeekByDay()).weeksOfMonthByDay();

```

### Using the Rules
#### Matching
The `matches()` function will test a date to check if all of the recurrence rules match. It returns `true` if the date matches, `false` otherwise.
```js
const interval = dayjs("01/01/2020").recur().every(2).days();
interval.matches("02/01/2020"); // false
interval.matches("03/01/2020"); // true
```

You may also see if a date matches before the start date or after the end date by passing `true` as the second argument to `matches()`.
```js
const interval = dayjs("01/01/2020").recur().every(2).days();
interval.matches("30/12/2019"); // false
interval.matches("30/12/2019", true); // true
```

#### Exceptions
To prevent a date from matching that would normally match, use the `except()` function.

```js
const recurrence = dayjs("01/01/2020").recur().every(1).day().except("02/01/2020");
recurrence.matches("02/01/2020"); // false
```


#### Overriding and Forgetting
If a rule is created with the same measurement of a previous rule, it will override the previous rule. Rules can also be removed from a recurrence.

```js
// Create a recurrence that matches every day, with an exception
const recurrence = dayjs("01/01/2020").recur().every(1).day().except("03/01/2020");

// This will override the previous rule and match every 2 days instead.
recurrence.every(2).days();

// Exceptions can also be removed by passing a date to the forget() function.
recurrence.forget("03/01/2020");

// Rules can be removed by passing the measurement to the forget() function.
recurrence.forget("days");
```


#### Generating Dates
It is also possible to generate dates from the rules. These functions require a starting date.

```js
var recurrence, nextDates;

// Create a recurrence
recurrence = dayjs("01/01/2020").recur().every(2).days();

// Generate the next three dates as moments
// Outputs: [dayjs("03/01/2020"), moment("05/01/2020"), moment("07/01/2020")]
nextDates = recurrence.next(3); 

// Generate the next three dates, formatted in local format
// Outputs: ["03/01/2020", "05/01/2020", "07/01/2020"]
nextDates = recurrence.next(3, "L");

// Generate previous three dates, formatted in local format
// Outputs: ["30/12/2020", "28/12/2020", "26/12/2020"]
nextDates = recurrence.previous(3, "L");
```

If your recurrence does not have a start date set, or if it does but you want to start at a different date, use the `fromDate()` method first.
```js
const recurrence = dayjs("01/01/2020").recur().every(2).days();
recurrence.fromDate("05/02/2020");

// Outputs: ["06/02/2020", "08/02/2020", "10/02/2020"]
nextDates = recurrence.next(3, "L");
```

With both a start date and an end date set, you can generate all dates within that range that match the pattern (including the start/end dates).
```js
const recurrence = dayjs().recur("01/01/2020", "07/01/2020").every(2).days();

// Outputs: ["01/01/2020", "03/01/2020", "05/01/2020", "07/01/2020"]
allDates = recurrence.all("L");
```


**Important Note:** These functions may be very inefficient/slow. They work by attempting to match every date from the start of a range until the desired number of dates have been generated. So if you attempt to get 10 dates for a rule that matches once a year, it will run the match function for ~3650 days.
